## Problem Statement

Describe the problem you are trying to solve into details.

What is the problem, why you want to address this problem, when this problem was discovered, who discovered or caused this problem and how you ended up in this problem.

Leave no questions unanswered. Include relevant sources/links that further describes the problem.

## Decision

### Deciding Factors

List the factors that should be considered taking into account the current situation and constraints such as implementation cost, schedule, technology, available resources, time to market, total cost of ownership etc.

### Viable Options

List out all the possible options that can solve the problem.

You don't want to hear the question "Did you consider this option?" during the final review as this leads to loss of credibility and question of other architectural decisions.

This section also helps ensure that you heard others’ opinions; explicitly stating other opinions helps enroll their advocates in your decision.

For each possible option, talk about the pros and cons. Include examples, description, links to more information

- [Option 1](<>)
  example | usage | code-samples | images

  - **Pros:**
  - **Cons:**
  - **Neutral:**

- [Option 2](<>)
  example | usage | code-samples | images

  - **Pros:**
  - **Cons:**
  - **Neutral:**

### Final Decision Made

What was the final decision?
Which option did you take?
Does that option address the problem taking into account all the deciding factors?

Outline why you selected a position. This is probably as important as the decision itself.

**Chosen Option:** {title of the option}
**Why:**

-

### Implications

A decision comes with many implications.

For example, a decision might introduce a need to make other decisions, create new requirements, or modify existing requirements; pose additional constraints to the environment; require renegotiating scope or schedule with customers; or require additional staff training.

Clearly understanding and stating your decision’s implications can be very effective in gaining buy-in and creating a roadmap for architecture execution.

## Notes

Because the decision-making process can take weeks, it useful to capture notes and issues/conerns that the team discusses during meetings.

Explain the results of the decision over the long term.
Did it work, not work, was changed, upgraded, etc.
What is happening since then?
How is the final option chosen performing?
Knowing what you know now, what would you advise people to do differently?

## Glossary

The definition of terms used and in what context they refer to. This helps eliminates any misunderstanding or confusions that may raise due to different interpretation of the same word.
